# Rust Compresion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexcrichton/rs-splay.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexcrichton/rs-splay)

This repository aims to house various implementations of compression algorithms,
all written in rust. This is still very much a work in progress.

```
rustpkg install github.com/alexcrichton/rust-compress
```
